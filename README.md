## Features
- Scraping up to 60,000 Indonesian reviews from Google Play Store using `google-play-scraper` and `langdetect`.
- Comprehensive text cleaning (emoji removal, URL/hashtag/user mention stripping, slang normalization, casing, punctuation removal).
- Language-specific stemming and stopword removal with **Sastrawi** and **NLTK**.
- Rule-based sentiment labeling via positive/negative lexicons with negation handling.
- Exploratory visualizations: score distributions, word clouds, class percentages, top-10 word frequencies.
- Experiments with three deep-learning classifiers: LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU.
- Model training with callbacks: `EarlyStopping`, `ReduceLROnPlateau`, `ModelCheckpoint`, and custom accuracy-based stop.
- Performance comparison and inference function with confidence scores.

## Usage

Clone the repo and navigate into the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/indonesia-play-review-sentiment.git
cd indonesia-play-review-sentiment
```

### 1. Data Scraping

Run `scrape_and_preprocess.py` to:
- Scrape reviews for `com.supercell.hayday` (60k by default) filtered by lang=`id`.
- Filter non-Indonesian text via `langdetect`.
- Remove duplicates and save to `hayday_reviews.csv`.

```bash
python scrape_and_preprocess.py --app_id com.supercell.hayday --target_reviews 60000
```

### 2. Data Loading

Load the CSV into a DataFrame for downstream steps:

```python
from label_sentiment import load_dataset

df = load_dataset('hayday_reviews.csv')
```

### 3. Preprocessing

The `EnhancedGamePreprocessor` class handles:
1. Case folding, emoji removal, URL/hashtag/user cleaning.
2. Punctuation and digit removal.
3. Slang normalization via a custom dictionary.
4. Stopword removal (Indonesian, English, custom) while preserving negations.
5. Stemming with Sastrawi.

Use it to clean and tokenize:

```python
from scrape_and_preprocess import EnhancedGamePreprocessor

pre = EnhancedGamePreprocessor()
df['clean_text'] = df['content'].apply(pre.clean)
```

### 4. Sentiment Labeling

`label_sentiment.py` fetches positive/negative lexicons from GitHub and labels each review:

```python
from label_sentiment import sentiment_analysis_lexicon

score, label = sentiment_analysis_lexicon(df['clean_text'].iloc[0])
```

Results stored in `hasil_label_sentimen.csv` with columns: `labeling_score`, `labeling`.

### 5. Visualization

Run `visualize.py` to generate:
- Bar charts for original vs. labeled distributions.
- Word clouds per sentiment class.
- Pie chart of class percentages.
- Bar chart of top-10 words.

```bash
python visualize.py
```

### 6. Model Preparation & Training

`train_models.py` defines three experiments:
1. **LSTM** (80/20 split, 200-length sequences)
2. **BiLSTM** (70/30 split, 100-length)
3. **GRU** (80/20, 200-length)

Each uses embedding layers, dropout, batch normalization, and trains with callbacks. Outputs saved in `saved_models/`.

```bash
python train_models.py
```

### 7. Model Evaluation

Use `evaluate.py` to:
- Generate confusion matrices and classification reports.
- Plot validation-accuracy comparisons.
- Summarize train vs. test accuracy in a DataFrame.

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

### 8. Inference

Run `inference.py` for new texts:

```bash
python inference.py
```

Or use the `predict_sentiment` function:

```python
from inference import predict_sentiment

result = predict_sentiment(
    "Game ini seru banget!", model=bilstm_model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer, preprocessor=pre, le=label_encoder,
    max_length=100
)
print(result)
```

## Results & Conclusion

- **BiLSTM** achieved the best test accuracy (94%) with strong generalization (train 96.1%).
- **LSTM** reached 96.0% train and balanced for test accuracy (93%).
- **GRU** balanced performance (test 92%).
- Lexicon-based labeling provides quick bootstrapping but can mis-handle complex negations.

Overall, the pipeline demonstrates an effective workflow to analyze Indonesian app reviews using both rule-based and DL methods.
